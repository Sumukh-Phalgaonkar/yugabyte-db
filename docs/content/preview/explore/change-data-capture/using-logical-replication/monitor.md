## Status of the deployed connector

You can use the rest APIs to monitor your deployed connectors. The following operations are available:

* List all connectors

   ```sh
   curl -X GET localhost:8083/connectors/
   ```

* Get a connector's configuration

   ```sh
   curl -X GET localhost:8083/connectors/<connector-name>
   ```

* Get the status of all tasks with their configuration

   ```sh
   curl -X GET localhost:8083/connectors/<connector-name>/tasks
   ```

* Get the status of the specified task

   ```sh
   curl -X GET localhost:8083/connectors/<connector-name>/tasks/<task-id>
   ```

* Get the connector's status, and the status of its tasks

   ```sh
   curl -X GET localhost:8083/connectors/<connector-name>/status
   ```

## Metrics

### CDC Service metrics

Provide information about CDC service in YugabyteDB.

| Metric name | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| cdcsdk_change_event_count | `long` | The Change Event Count metric shows the number of records sent by the CDC Service. |
| cdcsdk_traffic_sent | `long` | The number of milliseconds since the connector has read and processed the most recent event. |
| cdcsdk_event_lag_micros | `long` | The LAG metric is calculated by subtracting the timestamp of the latest record in the WAL of a tablet from the last record sent to the CDC connector. |
| cdcsdk_expiry_time_ms | `long` | The time left to read records from WAL is tracked by the Stream Expiry Time (ms). |

In addition to the built-in support for JMX metrics that Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect provide, the Debezium YugabyteDB connector provides the following types of metrics.

### Snapshot metrics

The **MBean** is `debezium.postgres:type=connector-metrics,context=snapshot,server=<topic.prefix>`.

Snapshot metrics are not exposed unless a snapshot operation is active, or if a snapshot has occurred since the last connector start.

The following table lists the shapshot metrics that are available.

| Attributes | Type | Description |
| :--------- | :--- | :---------- |
| `LastEvent` | string | The last snapshot event that the connector has read. |
| `MilliSecondsSinceLastEvent` | long | The number of milliseconds since the connector has read and processed the most recent event. |
| `TotalNumberOfEventsSeen` | long | The total number of events that this connector has seen since last started or reset. |
| `NumberOfEventsFiltered` | long | The number of events that have been filtered by include/exclude list filtering rules configured on the connector. |
| `CapturedTables` | string[] | The list of tables that are captured by the connector. |
| `QueueTotalCapacity` | int | The length the queue used to pass events between the snapshotter and the main Kafka Connect loop. |
| `QueueRemainingCapacity` | int | The free capacity of the queue used to pass events between the snapshotter and the main Kafka Connect loop. |
| `TotalTableCount` | int | The total number of tables that are being included in the snapshot. |
| `RemainingTableCount` | int | The number of tables that the snapshot has yet to copy. |
| `SnapshotRunning` | boolean | Whether the snapshot was started. |
| `SnapshotPaused` | boolean | Whether the snapshot was paused. |
| `SnapshotAborted` | boolean | Whether the snapshot was aborted. |
| `SnapshotCompleted` | boolean | Whether the snapshot completed. |
| `SnapshotDurationInSeconds` | long | The total number of seconds that the snapshot has taken so far, even if not complete. Includes also time when snapshot was paused. |
| `SnapshotPausedDurationInSeconds` | long | The total number of seconds that the snapshot was paused. If the snapshot was paused several times, the paused time adds up. |
| `RowsScanned` | Map<String, Long> | Map containing the number of rows scanned for each table in the snapshot. Tables are incrementally added to the Map during processing. Updates every 10,000 rows scanned and upon completing a table. |
| `MaxQueueSizeInBytes` | long | The maximum buffer of the queue in bytes. This metric is available if `max.queue.size.in.bytes` is set to a positive long value. |
| `CurrentQueueSizeInBytes` | long | The current volume, in bytes, of records in the queue. |

The connector also provides the following additional snapshot metrics when an incremental snapshot is executed:

| Attributes | Type | Description |
| :--------- | :--- | :---------- |
| `ChunkId` | string | The identifier of the current snapshot chunk. |
| `ChunkFrom` | string | The lower bound of the primary key set defining the current chunk. |
| `ChunkTo` | string | The upper bound of the primary key set defining the current chunk. |
| `TableFrom` | string | The lower bound of the primary key set of the currently snapshotted table. |
| `TableTo` | string | The upper bound of the primary key set of the currently snapshotted table. |

### Streaming metrics

The **MBean** is `debezium.postgres:type=connector-metrics,context=streaming,server=<topic.prefix>`.

The following table lists the streaming metrics that are available.

| Attributes | Type | Description |
| :--------- | :--- | :---------- |
| `LastEvent` | string | The last streaming event that the connector has read. |
| `MilliSecondsSinceLastEvent` | long | The number of milliseconds since the connector has read and processed the most recent event. |
| `TotalNumberOfEventsSeen` | long | The total number of events that this connector has seen since the last start or metrics reset. |
| `TotalNumberOfCreateEventsSeen` | long | The total number of create events that this connector has seen since the last start or metrics reset. |
| `TotalNumberOfUpdateEventsSeen` | long | The total number of update events that this connector has seen since the last start or metrics reset. |
| `TotalNumberOfDeleteEventsSeen` | long | The total number of delete events that this connector has seen since the last start or metrics reset. |
| `NumberOfEventsFiltered` | long | The number of events that have been filtered by include/exclude list filtering rules configured on the connector. |
| `CapturedTables` | string[] | The list of tables that are captured by the connector. |
| `QueueTotalCapacity` | int | The length the queue used to pass events between the streamer and the main Kafka Connect loop. |
| `QueueRemainingCapacity` | int | The free capacity of the queue used to pass events between the streamer and the main Kafka Connect loop. |
| `Connected` | boolean | Flag that denotes whether the connector is currently connected to the database server. |
| `MilliSecondsBehindSource` | long | The number of milliseconds between the last change eventâ€™s timestamp and the connector processing it. The values will incoporate any differences between the clocks on the machines where the database server and the connector are running. |
| `NumberOfCommittedTransactions` | long | The number of processed transactions that were committed. |
| `SourceEventPosition` | Map<String, String> | The coordinates of the last received event. |
| `LastTransactionId` | string | Transaction identifier of the last processed transaction. |
| `MaxQueueSizeInBytes` | long | The maximum buffer of the queue in bytes. This metric is available if `max.queue.size.in.bytes` is set to a positive long value. |
| `CurrentQueueSizeInBytes` | long | The current volume, in bytes, of records in the queue. |
